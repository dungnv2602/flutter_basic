//A widget that positions its children relative to the edges of its box.
//
//This class is useful if you want to overlap several children in a simple way, for example having some text and an image, overlaid with a gradient and a button attached to the bottom.
//
//Each child of a Stack widget is either positioned or non-positioned. Positioned children are those wrapped in a Positioned widget that has at least one non-null property. The stack sizes itself to contain all the non-positioned children, which are positioned according to alignment (which defaults to the top-left corner in left-to-right environments and the top-right corner in right-to-left environments). The positioned children are then placed relative to the stack according to their top, right, bottom, and left properties.

//The stack paints its children in order with the first child being at the bottom. If you want to change the order in which the children paint, you can rebuild the stack with the children in the new order. If you reorder the children in this way, consider giving the children non-null keys. These keys will cause the framework to move the underlying objects for the children to their new locations rather than recreate them at their new location.

///Stack
///The Stack widget allows us to put up multiple layers of widgets onto the screen.
///The widget takes multiple children and orders them from bottom to top. So the first item is the bottommost and the last is the topmost.
///The size of the Stack is the size of the largest member in the layer. So if the bottom layer covers the complete screen then the size of the Stack is the complete screen.
///Each member in the stack needs to be positioned or aligned, or else it ends up in the top left corner by default.
